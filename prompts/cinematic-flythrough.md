Create a real-time, audio-reactive visual that feels alive and constantly evolving. The scene should never loop obviously and should continuously introduce new motion, transformations, and spatial changes to keep the viewer guessing what comes next.

The camera or viewpoint should feel like it is moving with the visual—floating, drifting, diving, or being pulled through the scene. The visual should use the full viewport and interact with the screen boundaries (warping edges, stretching space, bending perspective, or breaking the frame).

Use multiple audio features (bass, mids, highs, overall energy, transients/peaks) to drive different aspects of the scene such as:

Geometry deformation and scale

Camera movement and speed

Color shifts and brightness

Spatial warping and distortion

Emissive glow, pulses, or shockwaves

On big drops or strong transients, the screen should visibly react: heavy distortion, space bending, brief chaos, explosive motion, or dramatic scene transitions that make the visual feel like it “hits” with the music.

The visual style should feel dynamic, immersive, and cinematic—like traveling through a living world made of light, shapes, and energy. Avoid static compositions. Favor flow, motion, transformation, and surprise.

The result should feel organic, hypnotic, and unpredictable, while still being tightly synchronized to the music. The goal is to make the screen feel alive, reactive, and immersive, as if the viewer is inside the visual and moving through it.
