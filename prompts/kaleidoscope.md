Core Visual Description: Generate a 3D-feeling kaleidoscopic tunnel composed of layered, geometric grid structures. The visual must feel hypnotic and surreal, utilizing recursive folding and polar coordinate transformations.Technical Requirements:Symmetry & Geometry: Use a foldRotate function with 8-fold symmetry. The main texture should be derived from signed distance functions (SDFs), specifically a sdRect (Rectangle) that is distorted through iterative folding and rotations.Audio-Reactive Uniforms: The shader must support and utilize the following uniforms:u_time: Constant forward flow.u_tunnelSpeed: Controls the scale/perspective of the layers (linked to audio energy).u_colorShiftSpeed: Modulates the hue transition tempo (linked to spectral flux and novelty).u_beatPulse: Triggers a 0–1 spike for visual flashes (linked to beat detection).u_dropActive & u_dropIntensity: Controls massive "reality-warping" effects, increasing saturation and distortion during musical drops.u_timeDistortion: Accelerates the internal clock for a "fast-forward" effect during high-intensity moments.Layering Logic: Implement the "Tunnel" using a loop of $N=6$ instances. Each layer should calculate its own progress and t (time-offset) to create a sense of moving through an infinite corridor.Color Space: Use HSV-to-RGB conversion for vibrant, shifting neon palettes.Reactivity Logic (JS-side): * Use an Attack/Release smoothing algorithm for all inputs.Tunnel Speed should have a fast attack and slow release (e.g., $0.05s$ attack, $0.8s$ release) to create a "momentum" feeling.Combine spectral flatness (tonality) and novelty (onsets) to drive the colorShiftSpeed.
